        Depending on the input, this can result in using a lot of processing
        power and time. The whole process would take approximately 5 seconds to
        return a result to the client. Keep in mind we’re talking about 1 item,
        a contact from a contact book. After a while, a new requirement is
        added. Solution must support companies that manage their contacts
        organized in files. We agreed to develop a web application that would
        support upload of dataset files, like .csv. The new web application
        should support third party integrations. Some of them are the ESP/CRM
        services, like Mailchimp. User does not need to see the result
        immediately. System can later notify the user about the result, when the
        process finishes. This information is the key that we need to leverage
        on when developing our solution. So here’s how we did it.
